}
\arguments{
\item{vcf}{string defining the path to VCF file;}

\item{vcfR.object}{object of class vcfR;}

\item{cross}{type of cross. Must be one of: \code{"outcross"} for full-sibs;
\code{"f2 intercross"} for an F2 intercross progeny; \code{"f2 backcross"};
\code{"ri self"} for recombinant inbred lines by self-mating; or
\code{"ri sib"} for recombinant inbred lines by sib-mating.}

\item{parent1}{\code{string} specifying sample ID of the first parent. If f2 backcross population, define here the ID of the backcrossed parent.}

\item{parent2}{\code{string} specifying sample ID of the second parent.}

\item{f1}{\code{string} if you are working with f2 intercross or backcross populations you may have f1 parents in you vcf, specify its ID here}

\item{only_biallelic}{if TRUE (default) only biallelic markers are considered, if FALSE multiallelic markers are included.}

\item{output_info_rds}{define a name for the file with alleles information.}
}
\description{
Converts data from a vcf file to onemap initial object, while identify 
the appropriate marker segregation patterns.
}
\details{
Only biallelic SNPs and indels for diploid variant sites are considered.

Genotype information on the parents is required for all cross types. For
full-sib progenies, both outbred parents must be genotyped. For backcrosses,
F2 intercrosses and recombinant inbred lines, the \emph{original inbred
lines} must be genotyped. Particularly for backcross progenies, the
\emph{recurrent line must be provided as the first parent} in the function
arguments.

Marker type is determined based on parental genotypes. Variants for which parent
genotypes cannot be determined are discarded.

Reference sequence ID and position for each variant site are also stored.
