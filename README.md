# OneMap

_OneMap_ is a software for constructing genetic maps in experimental
crosses: full-sib, RILs, F2 and backcrosses. It was developed by
Gabriel R A Margarido, Marcelo Mollinari and A Augusto F Garcia.

It has been available on CRAN from several years
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html). Its last
version was updated on 2013-09-09.

This github page has his version under development, and is a fork of
Marcelo's repository. We do not intend to have a real fork, in the
sense that there will be no two different versions. Only for my
convenience, I will try to add some new functions here (experimental
work) and, once it is done, we will synchronize the repositories and
add it to CRAN.
